au-address-validation-api
=========================

Yet another Google geocode address validation framework (maps API V3). 
Centered around Australian addresses and uses jQuery and jQuery-ui (for the auto-complete)

Load index.html in your browser to see it working 
(will need an internet connection to load the Google Maps, etc .js files)

It's client-side, so you're unlikely to hit the 2500 daily request limit.

Cheers,
Silas.
